*I don't write code — Claude Code and Codex do. But telling them what to do, in what order, with what context, and verifying the result — that's where all the time goes. Maestro-Flow makes that orchestration automatic.*

## Background

This project is a **ground-up rewrite** of [Claude-Code-Workflow (CCW)](https://github.com/catlog22/Claude-Code-Workflow), my earlier multi-CLI orchestration framework. CCW proved that coordinating Claude, Codex, Gemini and other AI agents through structured workflows is powerful — but it grew complex. Too many layers, too many abstractions.

Maestro-Flow takes the core ideas that worked and rebuilds them with a clear philosophy: **less ceremony, faster execution.** The spec-driven phase pipeline is inspired by [GET SHIT DONE (GSD)](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done) — its context engineering approach and atomic commit discipline are genuinely elegant. Maestro-Flow adopts those design patterns while adding what GSD doesn't have: a real-time visual dashboard, multi-agent execution with Claude Agent SDK, and an autonomous Commander that keeps the pipeline moving without you.

**What changed from CCW:**
- Stripped the heavy session/beat orchestration layer — replaced with lightweight skill-based routing
- Merged the terminal dashboard into a proper web UI with Linear-style Kanban
- Unified CLI tool invocation through a single `ccw cli` interface
- Added autonomous Commander Agent (assess → decide → dispatch loop)
- Built a complete Issue closed-loop system (discover → analyze → plan → execute → close)

**What we kept:**
- Multi-CLI orchestration (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Qwen, OpenCode)
- Structured workflows as Markdown definitions
- Slash commands as the user interface
- Agent definitions as focused role specifications

## What It Does

You describe what you want. Maestro-Flow figures out which agents to use, in what order, with what context — and drives it to completion.

```bash
# Natural language — Maestro-Flow routes to the optimal command chain
/maestro "implement OAuth2 authentication with refresh tokens"

# Or step by step
/maestro-init                    # Set up project workspace
/maestro-roadmap                 # Create phased roadmap interactively
/maestro-plan 1                  # Generate execution plan for Phase 1
/maestro-execute 1               # Wave-based parallel agent execution
/maestro-verify 1                # Goal-backward verification
```

### The Pipeline

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[init] --> B[brainstorm]
    B --> C[roadmap]
    C --> D[analyze]
    D --> E[plan]
    E --> F[execute]
    F --> G[verify]
    G --> H[review]
    H --> I[test]
    I --> J[transition]
    J -->|next phase| D
```

Each phase has explicit status tracking. The dashboard shows what's happening and what to do next.

### Quick Channels

Not everything needs a full pipeline:

| Channel | Flow | When |
|---------|------|------|
| `/maestro-quick` | analyze → plan → execute | Quick fixes, small features |
| Scratch mode | `analyze -q` → `plan --dir` → `execute --dir` | No roadmap, just get it done |
| `/maestro "..."` | AI-routed command chain | Describe intent, let Maestro-Flow decide |

---

## The Dashboard

A real-time project control panel at `http://127.0.0.1:3001`. Built with React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, and WebSocket live updates.

### Four Views

| View | Key | What You See |
|------|-----|-------------|
| **Board** | `K` | Kanban columns — Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done. Phase cards and Issue cards side by side. |
| **Timeline** | `T` | Gantt-style phase timeline with progress bars |
| **Table** | `L` | Every phase and issue in a sortable table |
| **Center** | `C` | Command center — active executions, issue queue, quality metrics |

### What You Can Do

- **Pick an agent, hit play** — Select Claude / Codex / Gemini on any Issue card, click execute
- **Batch dispatch** — Multi-select Issues, send them all to agents in parallel
- **Watch agents work** — Real-time CLI output streaming panel
- **Full Issue lifecycle** — Create, analyze, plan, execute, close — all from the board
- **Linear sync** — Import/export Issues to Linear for team workflows

### Commander Agent

The autonomous supervisor. Runs a tick loop in the background:

```
assess → decide → dispatch → wait → assess → ...
```

It reads project state (phases, tasks, Issues, agent slots), decides what needs attention, and dispatches agents automatically. Three profiles: `conservative`, `balanced`, `aggressive`.

When the Commander is on, Issues flow from discovery to resolution without manual intervention.

---

## Issue Closed-Loop

Issues aren't just tickets — they're a self-healing pipeline:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Discover] --> B[Create]
    B --> C[Analyze]
    C --> D[Plan]
    D --> E[Execute]
    E --> F[Close]
```

| Stage | Command | What Happens |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Discover** | `/manage-issue-discover` | 8-perspective scan: bugs, UX, tech debt, security, performance, testing gaps, code quality, documentation |
| **Analyze** | `/manage-issue-analyze` | Root cause analysis via CLI exploration. Writes structured `analysis` to the Issue. |
| **Plan** | `/manage-issue-plan` | Generates solution steps — target files, code changes, verification criteria |
| **Execute** | `/manage-issue-execute` | Dual-mode: Dashboard API dispatch when server is up, direct CLI execution when offline |
| **Close** | Automatic | Verification passes → `resolved` → `closed` |

### How Issues Connect to the Pipeline

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Phase Pipeline
        EX[execute] --> VE[verify]
        VE --> RE[review]
        RE --> TE[test]
    end
    subgraph Issue Loop
        DI[discover] --> AN[analyze]
        AN --> PL[plan]
        PL --> IX[execute]
    end
    RE -->|critical/high findings| DI
    TE -->|test failures| DI
    VE -->|verification gaps| DI
    IX -->|fixed code| EX
```

Quality commands (`review`, `test`, `verify`) automatically create Issues for problems they find. Issue fixes flow back into the phase. The loop closes itself.

---

## Multi-Agent Execution

Maestro-Flow doesn't pick one AI — it uses them together:

```
              ┌────────────────────────────────┐
              │      ExecutionScheduler         │
              │   (wave-based parallel engine)  │
              └───────────┬────────────────────┘
                          │
           ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
           │              │              │
     ┌─────┴─────┐ ┌─────┴──────┐ ┌────┴──────┐
     │  Claude    │ │   Codex    │ │  Gemini   │
     │ Agent SDK  │ │  CLI       │ │  CLI      │
     └───────────┘ └────────────┘ └───────────┘
```

- **Wave execution** — Independent tasks run in parallel across agents, dependent tasks wait for predecessors
- **Agent SDK** — Native Claude Agent SDK for Claude Code processes
- **CLI adapters** — Codex, Gemini, Qwen, OpenCode all accessible through `ccw cli`
- **Workspace isolation** — Each agent gets a clean execution context

## Acknowledgments

Maestro-Flow stands on the shoulders of two projects:

- **[GET SHIT DONE](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done)** by TACHES — The spec-driven development model, context engineering philosophy, and atomic commit discipline that shaped Maestro-Flow's pipeline design. GSD proved that structured meta-prompting is the right way to drive AI agents at scale.

- **[Claude-Code-Workflow](https://github.com/catlog22/Claude-Code-Workflow)** — The predecessor to Maestro-Flow. CCW pioneered multi-CLI orchestration (Gemini + Codex + Qwen + Claude), skill-based workflow routing, and team agent architecture. Maestro-Flow is CCW rebuilt from scratch — faster, leaner, with a visual dashboard and autonomous commander.
