# Pre-task Thinking: roadmap

## Purpose

Roadmap decomposes requirements into a session DAG. Each session is an atomic work unit with scope, success criteria, and dependency edges, each running the full analyze→plan→execute→verify lifecycle. It produces `roadmap.json` (machine-readable DAG, primary) and `roadmap.md` (human-readable summary). Formal spec documents go through `blueprint`.

Pipeline position: brainstorm/blueprint/analyze → **roadmap** → analyze {session} → plan → execute.

## Input Interpretation

$ARGUMENTS determines the execution mode:

| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| Create (default) | requirement text / `@file` / `--from` provided | build a session DAG from the requirement or upstream context |
| Revise | `--revise [instructions]` | read the `current-roadmap` artifact, apply changes, preserve already-completed sessions |
| Review | `--review` | read-only health assessment of the session DAG |
| Resume | `-c` / `--continue` | continue from the last checkpoint |

No arguments and no `--revise`/`--review` → error (missing requirement, E001).

## Required Context

Pre-load (all optional, continue if missing):

1. **Specs**: `maestro load --type spec --category arch` — load architecture constraints needed for session decomposition
2. **Wiki search**: `maestro search "{requirement keywords}" --json` → prior knowledge

## Boundaries and Invariants

- All output is written to `{run_dir}/outputs/`.
- Do not write `.workflow/roadmap.md` — roadmap is a Run artifact, not a project-level file.
- Sessions are registered into `state.json.sessions[]`; do not touch already-completed sessions, and do not write `milestones[]` / `current_milestone` / `accumulated_context` (deprecated fields).
- Scope guard: define only the roadmap shape, do not pre-resolve task splitting or intra-session decomposition (which belongs to plan).
- **Default is 1 session** — split only when all three hard-dependency conditions hold: Session B's code calls Session A's real output at runtime (cannot mock), the two cannot develop concurrently via a contract/interface agreement, and every Session A task must complete before any Session B task starts. If only 1-2 conditions hold, keep in one session and use wave dependencies.
- **Minimum 5 tasks per session** — a session with fewer must be merged into an adjacent one.
- **Re-justify after decomposition** — if the result has more than 3 sessions, re-check each split against the 3 hard-dependency conditions and merge any that are unjustified.
- Interaction style: **convergent menu-driven** (per `ref/interview-mechanics.md`); decision tree (strict order): mode (create/revise/review) → requirement scope (MVP/complete/phased) → decomposition strategy (progressive/direct/auto) → session boundaries → session dependencies. Write-back target: the "Roadmap Decisions" section of `{run_dir}/outputs/roadmap.md` (create if absent). Skip conditions: `--revise`, `--review` jump directly to the corresponding mode. Exit condition: consensus reached or an explicit user signal → finalize the Roadmap Decisions section.

## Risk Checklist

- Is the DAG acyclic and complete? Every session must have scope, success criteria, and valid dependency edges — a cycle or dangling edge breaks the lifecycle.
- Are already-completed sessions preserved? `--revise` must not touch or renumber completed sessions in `state.json.sessions[]`.
- Did decomposition stay at roadmap altitude? Pre-resolving task splitting or intra-session decomposition is plan's job, not roadmap's.
- Are deprecated fields avoided? Writing `milestones[]` / `current_milestone` / `accumulated_context` reintroduces removed concepts.

## Gate Intent

- `dag-valid`: the session DAG is acyclic and complete — every session has scope, success criteria, and valid dependency edges, with no dangling or cyclic edges — before `roadmap.json` is finalized.
- `sessions-registered`: sessions are written into `state.json.sessions[]` without touching already-completed sessions or the deprecated `milestones[]` / `current_milestone` / `accumulated_context` fields.
